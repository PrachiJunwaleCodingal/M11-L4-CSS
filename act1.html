    <p>The Sun is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its gravity holds
        everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit.
    </p>

    <p>Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. There is strong evidence Mars was—billions of
        years
        ago—wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Adorned with a dazzling, complex system of icy rings, Saturn is unique in our solar system. The other giant
        planets have
        rings, but none are as spectacular as Saturn's.</p>
